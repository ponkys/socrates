# Socrates `beta`
--

Socrates is the design system that powers Onefootball web projects

It's a custom version of Bootstrap, so to run it, Bootstrap has to be included in your dependancies

It includes the following main packages:

- socrates-core `_socrates-core.scss` used on NewsDesk project
- socrates-product `_socrates-product.scss` used in Company website & Onefootball.com
- socrates-full `_socrates-full.scss`

### Module Status
- Typography `Done`
- Colors `Done`
- Spacing `Done`
- Icons `NOT DONE`
- Shadows `Done`
- Buttons `Done`
- Forms `Done`
- Badges `Done`
- Alerts `In Progress`
- Text Image `In Progress`
- Card `NOT DONE`
- Collection `NOT DONE`

### Usage
- I'm still working on distribution but for now please copy the `assets/scss` into your project
- as an example, just import the package you want inside your main Scss file

```scss
@import "_socrates-core.scss";
```

### What's next?
- There are few modules that I'm still working on.
- Any module requests are welcome.
- Project distribution, I've no idea how to do it properly via `npm`

### Who to ask
Please feel free to ask @zeroxme any questions or give feedback because the project is still in `Beta`
